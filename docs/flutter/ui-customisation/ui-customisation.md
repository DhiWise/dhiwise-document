# UI Customisation

Customise your application UI with Smart Editor, where you can easily **modify** all UI changes using handy **keyboard shortcuts** while having real-time design **preview** and **errors**, which helps you make UI more adaptive and accurate and also avoids switching back to your Figma design by providing you with all your necessities right here, while you create your application.

Modify widgets along with their properties and customise your UI for the supported widgets. Refer below to know about supported widgets and properties, and customisation features which can be done with the help of Smart Editor in your Flutter app:
