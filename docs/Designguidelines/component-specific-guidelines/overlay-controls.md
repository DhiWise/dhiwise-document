#### Steps to follow :
Firstly, while starting it you will necessarily need three components:

Commonly faced issues for dialog/ drawer/ bottomsheet being not identified from the design are, that the overlay does not cover the screen completely or the edges of a dialog go beyond the screen bounds.

To avoid such layering practices, follow the below guides:

1. The applied overlay should cover the screen completely, else dialog box/ drawer/ bottomsheet would not be detected,

2. The design for dialog should be in the exact **center** of the overlay, for the bottom sheet it must start from the **bottom**, and for the drawer, it must be on the **left** of the overlay,

3. The hierarchy of screen layers should go like this from the top, first should be your dialog box/ drawer/ bottomsheet, followed by the overlay, and lastly everything else below the overlay.
