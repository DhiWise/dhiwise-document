# Input Controls

Input controls are used in the app’s user interface to take user **inputs**, which makes it interactive to use and are commonly used in screen design. Refer to specific component guidelines while designing it in Figma, to get them correctly identified in DhiWise.


## **Checkbox**

Box shape for checkbox must be designed using <a href= "https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/360040450133#rectangle">Rectangle</a> only.

Checkbox’s **box** and its **Text** should be in a proper group as below;

The color of the Switch and its background rectangle should not be the **same**.


## **TextArea**

TextArea is used to get a text input with **multi-line**.  

For TextArea use <a href="https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/360040450133#rectangle">Rectangle</a> and Text inside it as a hint text to get it easily identified in DhiWise.

## **TextField**

Generally, TextField has a Text on top which says which type of field it is and a field to enter an input below with a hint text for reference.

The **Rectangle** and the **Text** above it must be placed in a proper hierarchy, with text on top followed by the rectangle with its **hint text**.
