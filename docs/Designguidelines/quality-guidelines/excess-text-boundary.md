# Excess Text Boundary

While working with your text objects you have to be very cautious, as a single misplacement can cause issues in your design.

In order to avoid such issues wrap your Text with its boundary so it does not misplace in your design, by **auto-width** in Figma.

When using a Text object with some other object for example Image, the Text needs to be aligned in the center with it. But if the Text is not wrapped according to its width and its size is made wider, then it will be misplaced from there.
