# Unwanted Components

Play with what is really needed!

Sometimes while designing a new screen, a Rectangle is placed over it and it is duplicated, but all the components of the previous screen are also placed on the newly created screen, which is a bad practice to be done.

Avoid such practices while you design a new screen, as it will affect on DhiWise while you convert your design to code.

:::info
Only keep components that are to be displayed in the design, and remove the others.
:::


Also remove extra elements being put on the other areas of the design, like the below GIF, as it will lead to misidentification of a component.
