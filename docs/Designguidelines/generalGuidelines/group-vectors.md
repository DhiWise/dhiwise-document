# Group Vectors

<a href="https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/360040450213-Vector-networks#Fills" target="_blank">Fill</a> elements 
like <b>images</b> can be created using ,<b>vectors</b>. Many different vectors are combined together to make a single vector image.

:::tip
It is recommended to manage all the vector images and paths inside a single group to avoid design issues.
:::

Combining elements together in a single group is a best practice, as it makes a clean design hierarchy easy to manage or identify a particular element.

If all the vectors are not placed into one group then all the images would be downloaded individually and this will not form a proper image design while doing design-to-code in DhiWise.
