Role access feature helps developers give CRUD APIs access to the right user. However, such a simple task is a headache to code. But, with the help of DhiWise, now, it is easier than ever to rightfully give CRUD access to models without any error or hours of writing lengthy code.

## Role access

Add and manage new roles for your application.

:::tip Example
In an online delivery services application, there are mainly three roles: a restaurant, a driver, and a customer. These are the three roles on the application and accordingly, the CRUD permission is given from the selected modules.

## Model list

Will showcase your current models.

## Action

Select if you want to give all access or only some such as **Create**, **View**, **Update** or **Delete**. 
Once you have selected the action you can update or you can even delete roles.
