# Build an iOS App

DhiWise's iOS app builder converts your app design to code, in minutes, with accuracy & view binding features. 

Bringing an app design to life, especially in code. One major hurdle for iOS developers is constraints with layout, which DhiWise automates in mere seconds. 

<div className="grid-cols-3 grid gap-20">
  <a href="#create-a-new-app" className="Card">
    <img src={blank} alt="" />
    <h4 className="">
      App design from Figma, Adobe XD, or Sketch
    </h4>
  </a>
  <a href="#create-from-template"  className="Card">
    <img src={template} alt="" />
    <h4 className="">
      Templates
    </h4>
  </a>
  <a href="#create-from-screen-library"  className="Card">
    <img src={SelectScreen} alt="" />
    <h4 className="">
      Screen library
    </h4>
  </a>
</div>

DhiWise converts your design to code by auto-identifying all your screen UI, components, and generates complete code for the same. Easily setup actions on your components like Navigation, API integration, Social authentication, and many more to easily generate your complete app in no time!
