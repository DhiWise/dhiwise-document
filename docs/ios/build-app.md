## Build App
Get your complete app code by building your app, and then <a href="/docs/ios/deploy-or-download-code#download">download</a> or sync it with <a href="/docs/ios/deploy-or-download-code#sync-application-code-to-gitlab">GitLab</a> & <a href="/docs/ios/deploy-or-download-code#sync-application-code-to-github">GitHub</a>.


As you are done with your iOS app setup, by modifying UI, adding actions on widgets or want to directly get the view code, follow the below steps for the same;

#### **Step 1:**
Go to the screen list, and click on `Build app`.

#### **Step 2:**
