# App Code

Once the configurations are complete, developers can click on `Build app` and generate the React admin panel code. If needed, developers can customize the code otherwise it is production-ready. Also, developers have complete ownership of their code. 

## Review code

In the left panel, the folder structure is generated on the selected code architecture. The folder structure of the application will be created automatically depending on the design, actions performed and configurations selected.

We recommend you to check the **README.md** file, this file consists of the following information: 

- How to run the project

- Folder structure

- Table content

- App drawer component 

- Edit drawer component

Furthermore, developers can **download** or sync their code to **GitHub** or **GitLab**.
