# Routes

Once the models are created, DhiWise auto-generates routes (The pathway of APIs). Furthermore, new routes can be added and edited with the help of logic builder and its advanced configuration options.  


Therefore, instead of writing lengthy code manually for routes, models, and APIs, developers can simply use the logic builder options to add, edit, manage and configure routes for multiple models and create custom business logic within minutes.

## Edit routes

Select the model route you want to **edit**, **clone**, **customize**, or create a **new route**.

Once you click on the `edit` you will get the option of model permission. 


## Model permission

You can select the **middleware** you want to apply for the operation and select the **attribute** of the model for which you desire the API response. Then click on **save** to successfully update your changes.

For adding custom logic you can check out our <a href="">Logic Builder</a>
