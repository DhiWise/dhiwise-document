# Add Permissions

Permissions are set to get control of your phone and access to your camera, photos, contact list, location, and phone storage. App permission requests pop up the first time an app needs access to data on your phone and are related to user privacy.

You can set Camera + Gallery, Storage permission, location, and Contact list access permission for any UI components.
