# Build an Android App

Android app builder is an app development software that converts app designs into code (Kotlin). It helps reduce the standard development lifecycle time by half. Furthermore, the UI code can be enhanced by adding various integrations & actions into the view components like API integrations, navigation, permissions, and more; therefore, producing a rich source code.

Choose one from below to start creating your app:

<div className="grid-cols-3 grid gap-20">
  <a href="#create-a-new-app" className="Card">
    <img src={blank} alt="" />
    <h4 className="">
      App design from Figma, Adobe XD, or Sketch
    </h4>
  </a>
  <a href="#create-from-template"  className="Card">
    <img src={template} alt="" />
    <h4 className="">
      Templates
    </h4>
  </a>
  <a href="#create-from-screen-library"  className="Card">
    <img src={SelectScreen} alt="" />
    <h4 className="">
      Screen Library
    </h4>
  </a>
</div>
