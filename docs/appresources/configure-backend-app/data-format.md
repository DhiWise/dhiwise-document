<h2>To create your format input the below options:</h2>

## Model
Select the "model" you wish to add. 
## Data type
You get the same data type with the exception of a new data type string.

In string, you have to enter "target",  select your model "attribute" then "operation" ("Space", '|',  ',') and model "attribute" again.

In the below image, we have created a data format for our model "user" and input the required values.
