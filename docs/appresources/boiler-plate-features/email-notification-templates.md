# Email notification templates
Nowadays, we expect instant communications especially with email because a lot depends on it. Therefore, on DhiWise, we have created a way for this essential feature to be on your app hassle-free with just a few clicks.  

## Add Email template

**fill in the template name, tag name, description, and editor, then click on create template. In that same way, you can create your email template as well.**  

- **Header/footer**: Create a specific headline or footer across all your email to showcase whatever you wish.  

- **Template name**: Enter the name of the template you are creating for. e.g offer deals or OTP codes. 

- **Tag name**: Categorize your different email templates by **tag names** to easily distinguish between them, for example, shipping order, account balance, etc.

- **Description**: Give your templates a brief description. It makes them easy to understand in the future. 

- **Editor**: Write down the content of your template. If you want to add dynamic content then write attribute name in <%= %>. Added attribute's style is valid only when you select attribute name with parenthesis. Example: <%= attributeName%> In the below image you can see the examples clearly. Here in the **email template editor**, you get a plethora of options to customize your text.
