# Documents

Documents feature offers developers information on the APIs generated in the Node.js application. Also, API documents have the option to download the postman file (All tested APIs) to share with colleagues along with the swagger file for a concise API documentation format.
## There are two types of API documents: 
swagger file and postman file.
### Documents
You first have to build an app to get the API documents.
In documents, you can see all the different APIs, routes, and HTTP methods. To understand more about any particular APIs, click on examine the response, routes, and all the other details.
**Authorize** helps developers set a global token to set authentication to the required APIs.
**The swagger file is already displayed on DhiWise in documents and the postman file you can download from the documents on the top right-hand corner.**
