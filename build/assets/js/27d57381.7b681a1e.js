For faster rebuilds, only files inside src are processed by Webpack.\nYou need to put any JS and CSS files inside src, otherwise Webpack won\u2019t see them.\n\nOnly files inside public can be used from public/index.html.\nRead instructions below for using assets from JavaScript and HTML.\n\nYou can, however, create more top-level directories.\nThey will not be included in the production build so you can use them for things like documentation.\n\n## Available Scripts\n\nIn the project directory, you can run:\n\n### `npm start`\n\nRuns the app in the development mode.<br>\nOpen [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.\n\nThe page will reload if you make edits.<br>\nYou will also see any lint errors in the console.\n\n### `npm test`\n\nLaunches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>\n\n### `npm run build`\n\nBuilds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>\nIt correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.\n\nThe build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>\nYour app is ready to be deployed!\n\n### `npm run eject`\n\n**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can\u2019t go back!**\n\nIf you aren\u2019t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.\n\nInstead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you\u2019re on your own.\n\nYou don\u2019t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn\u2019t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn\u2019t be useful if you couldn\u2019t customize it when you are ready for it.\n\n## Syntax Highlighting in the Editor\n\nTo configure the syntax highlighting in your favorite text editor, head to the [relevant Babel documentation page](https://babeljs.io/docs/editors) and follow the instructions. Some of the most popular editors are covered.\n\n## Displaying Lint Output in the Editor\n\n> Note: this feature is available with `react-scripts@0.2.0` and higher.<br>\n> It also only works with npm 3 or higher.\n> Some editors, including Sublime Text, Atom, and Visual Studio Code, provide plugins for ESLint.\n\nThey are not required for linting. You should see the linter output right in your terminal as well as the browser console. However, if you prefer the lint results to appear right in your editor, there are some extra steps you can do.\n\nYou would need to install an ESLint plugin for your editor first. Then, add a file called `.eslintrc` to the project root:\n\n{\n  "extends": "react-app"\n}\n\n\nNow your editor should report the linting warnings.\n\nNote that even if you edit your `.eslintrc` file further, these changes will **only affect the editor integration**. They won\u2019t affect the terminal and in-browser lint output. This is because Create React App intentionally provides a minimal set of rules that find common mistakes.\n\nIf you want to enforce a coding style for your project, consider using [Prettier](https://github.com/jlongster/prettier) instead of ESLint style rules.\n\n## Changing the Page `<title>`\n\nYou can find the source HTML file in the `public` folder of the generated project. You may edit the `<title>` tag in it to change the title from \u201cReact App\u201d to anything else.\n\nNote that normally you wouldn\u2019t edit files in the `public` folder very often. For example, adding a stylesheet is done without touching the HTML.\n\nIf you need to dynamically update the page title based on the content, you can use the browser [`document.title`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/title) API. For more complex scenarios when you want to change the title from React components, you can use [React Helmet](https://github.com/nfl/react-helmet), a third party library.\n\n## Installing a Dependency\n\nThe generated project includes React and ReactDOM as dependencies. It also includes a set of scripts used by Create React App as a development dependency. You may install other dependencies (for example, React Router) with `npm`:\n\n\nnpm install --save react-router\n\n\nAlternatively you may use `yarn`:\n\n\nyarn add react-router\n\n\nThis works for any library, not just `react-router`.\n\n## CRA User Guide\n\nYou can find detailed instructions on using Create React App and many tips in [its documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/).\n\n## How to Update to New Versions?\n\nPlease refer to the [User Guide](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/updating-to-new-releases) for this and other information.\n\n## What\u2019s Included?\n\nYour environment will have everything you need to build a modern single-page React app:\n\n- React, JSX, ES6, TypeScript and Flow syntax support.\n- Language extras beyond ES6 like the object spread operator.\n- Autoprefixed CSS, so you don\u2019t need `-webkit-` or other prefixes.\n- A fast interactive unit test runner with built-in support for coverage reporting.\n- A live development server that warns about common mistakes.\n- A build script to bundle JS, CSS, and images for production, with hashes and sourcemaps.\n- An offline-first [service worker](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/getting-started/primers/service-workers) and a [web app manifest](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/engage-and-retain/web-app-manifest/), meeting all the [Progressive Web App](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/making-a-progressive-web-app) criteria. (_Note: Using the service worker is opt-in as of `react-scripts@2.0.0` and higher_)\n- Hassle-free updates for the above tools with a single dependency.\n\nThe tradeoff is that **these tools are preconfigured to work in a specific way**. If your project needs more customization, you can ["eject"](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/available-scripts#npm-run-eject) and customize it, but then you will need to maintain this configuration.\n\n')),(0,i.kt)("br",null),(0,i.kt)("br",null),(0,i.kt)("p",null,"Got a question?\xa0",(0,i.kt)("a",{parentName:"p",href:"https://discord.com/invite/rFMnCG5MZ7"},(0,i.kt)("strong",{parentName:"a"},"Ask here")),"."))}p.isMDXComponent=!0},70286:(e,t,n)=>{n.d(t,{Z:()=>o});const o=n.p+"assets/images/ReactBuildApp-400de4df130ff70824f9d10c0cad3d42.gif"}}]);
